# HAARP

HAARP is my attempt at making a text-to-speech engine aimed at .NET developers who don't have thousands of dollars at their disposal to license a commercial speech synthesis solution.
Aside from often being prohibitively expensive, such engines are often restrictive in the customization options for voices, vocal parameters, and context-sensitive vocal qualities like intonation, stress, and timbre which are necessary to convey emotion and intent. My goal with this project is to offer at least rudimentary support for all of these things, and expand upon them over time.

Here is a short list of features I hope to support:
* Fully-procedural formant synthesis
* Highly customizable parameters for controlling how a voice behaves
* Support for sending speech directly to a file or stream
* Multiple options for sample format/rate
* Support for both IPA and X-SAMPA pronunciation dictionaries
* Singing

It is currently a heavy work-in-progress, and I welcome your input and/or contributions.
