# HAARP

HAARP* is my attempt at making a text-to-speech engine aimed at .NET developers who don't have thousands of dollars at their disposal to license a commercial speech synthesis solution.
Aside from often being prohibitively expensive, such engines are often restrictive in their available customization options for voices, voice parameters, and context-sensitive vocal qualities like intonation, stress, and timbre which are necessary to convey emotion and intent. My goal with this project is to offer at least rudimentary support for all of these things, and expand upon them over time.

Here is a short list of major features I hope to support:
* Fully-procedural [formant synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_synthesis#Formant_synthesis)
* Plentiful parameters for controlling how a voice sounds
* Support for sending speech directly to a WAV file or stream
* Multiple options for sample format and rate
* Support for both [IPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) and [X-SAMPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-SAMPA) pronunciation dictionaries
* Multiple language support (English and German are currently prioritized)
* Singing

It is currently a heavy work-in-progress, and I welcome your input and/or contributions.

_*The title is merely a placeholder until I think of something better._
