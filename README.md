# HAARP

HAARP is my attempt at making a text-to-speech engine aimed at .NET developers who don't have thousands of dollars at their disposal to license a commercial speech synthesis solution.
Aside from often being prohibitively expensive, such engines are often restrictive in the customization options for voices, vocal parameters, and context-sensitive vocal qualities like intonation, stress, and timbre to convey certain emotions. My goal with this project is to offer at least rudimentary support for all of these things, and expand upon them over time.

It is currently a heavy work-in-progress, and I welcome your input and/or contributions.
